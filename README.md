# Qiskit Global Summer School 2021 Labs
Labwork at Qiskit Global Summer school 2021 demonstrating applied algorithms and simulations on Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning using Qiskit.

## Lab 1: Introduction to Qiskit
#### Basic Rotations on One Qubit and Measurements on the Bloch Sphere
#### Quantum Circuits Using Multi-Qubit Gates
#### Oracles and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
#### Deutsch-Jozsa Problem
#### Quantum Solution to the Deutsch-Josza Problem

## Lab 2: Variational Quantum Algorithms
#### Variational Quantum Eigensolvers

Variational quantum eigensolvers use the variational method to approximate the ground state and minimal eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian $H$. The trial state now corresponds to a quantum state prepared by a variational quantum circuit and the corresponding expectation value is measured by executing the circuit on a quantum computer. A classical optimizer is then used to tune the circuit parameters and minimize the measured expectation value.
